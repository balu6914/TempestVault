# Development Guidelines for TempestVault

## Introduction

This document outlines the development guidelines for the TempestVault project, which integrates CrocSwap functionalities to provide enhanced liquidity management services. These guidelines are intended to ensure code quality, facilitate maintenance, and promote a consistent development environment.

## Coding Standards

### Solidity
- Follow the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/style-guide.html) for all Solidity contracts.
- Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and contracts.
- Document all functions and contracts using natspec comments.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Use TypeScript for all scripts and tests to take advantage of strong typing.

## Version Control

- Use Git for version control.
- Commit messages should be clear and follow the convention: `[TYPE] Description`, where `TYPE` includes feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore.
- Maintain a clean commit history by squashing related changes.

## Testing

- Strive for comprehensive test coverage. Write unit tests for all new code, and add integration tests where appropriate.
- Use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for running tests. Configure CI to run tests automatically on push and pull requests.
- Document how to run tests in the repository's README.

## Security

- Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
- Include thorough checks and balances in smart contracts, especially those interacting with external contracts.
- Conduct internal audits and consider third-party audits for critical components.

## Deployment

- Use migration scripts for deploying contracts on the blockchain. Document the deployment procedure in the README.
- Treat `mainnet` deployment with extra caution. Double-check configurations and perform dry runs on testnets.

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` with project setup, build instructions, and usage examples.
- Document any changes or improvements to the infrastructure or contracts in the `docs` directory.
- Keep inline comments up-to-date and relevant.

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews

- Require pull requests for merging code to the `main` branch. Ensure at least one other team member reviews the PR.
- Review code for readability, security, and adherence to the projectâ€™s guidelines.
- Use automated linters and formatting tools to enforce style guidelines.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

- Configure CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deploying applications.
- Ensure that the `main` branch always remains deployable.

## Environment Management

- Use environment variables to manage configuration and secret keys. Never commit sensitive information to version control.
- Maintain separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

## Collaboration

- Encourage team members to participate in code reviews and discussions. 
- Allocate time for regular knowledge-sharing sessions about project progress and new technologies.
